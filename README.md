# Art Showcase
##### Developed by: Willa Qu
Inspired by DeviantArt, Sketchfab, and ArtStation, this website allows users to upload 2D and 3D art to their gallery and dynamically reorder their pieces by dragging them around. The gallery page will showcase the 2D art as is and the 3D art rotating around its center axis. Otherwise, the users can add thumbnails which will take the place of their art on the gallery page. On an artâ€™s individual page, 3D art will have controls for the user to examine the details and 2D art will have a generated theme based on the colors of the piece.
